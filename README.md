# E-WasteNotHub

## Overview
E-WasteNotHub is a full-cycle e-waste management platform that connects sellers, volunteers, companies, admins, and buyers to promote sustainable electronics reuse. Sellers submit e-waste, volunteers pick up and deliver it, admins oversee the process, companies refurbish the devices, and buyers purchase quality refurbished products.

## How It Works

1. **Sellers** list their e-waste products on the platform.  
2. **Volunteers** pick up products from sellers and deliver them to the company for refurbishment.  
3. **Admins** monitor and control all operations—verifying sellers’ products, coordinating volunteers, and managing company workflows.  
4. **Company** refurbishes the e-waste devices and prepares them for sale.  
5. **Volunteers** also deliver refurbished products from the company to the buyers.  
6. **Buyers** browse and purchase verified, refurbished products via the platform.
